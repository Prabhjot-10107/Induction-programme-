# Day 1 
## 30th of July 2025 
My first day at GNDEC started with all students except the CSE and IT branch at the college Gurudwara Sahib where all the students have started their first day of their college and the atmosphere was very calm and the Gurudwara was very beautifully decorated. As after the Kirtan finished at Gurudwara sahib, we went to take the snaks and tea as per provided by the college in hostel no. 2. After that, we all go to Auditorium which was looking soo good as it was properly managed and the stage was also looking so good. After waiting for sometime, the host invited the speaker, Harpreet Mam (HOD) of applied science. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family and we are students.

Our Princpal Sir, motivated us to make the best use of platform. As our orientation was very good as it was the 70th anniverssary of GNDEC. Its been 70 years of shaping brillient minds. As it sounds very good that we were the part of their cellebration of 70th anniversary, which were dedicated to establishing the institute 

Then our first lecture was of 'UNIVERSAL HUMAN VALUES' an expert lecture by Dr. Priya Darshani Mam which was in auditorium of 2 hours which was a very intresting lecture on the basis of our daily physical, mentall and basic need and on our actual happiness. The main thing was that she tells us the difference between the real happiness which makes ud feel good for long time or a happiness which comes from the excitement which was for sometime. as this lecture is very helpfull for us to understood the difference between that two words or their clarification of those thing 

After that we have a lecture of Dr.Arvind Dhingra (Director-step & incharge-TAC) which was also in auditorium. As he gives us very good information about engineering and after that he started somes games im between girls and boys its like a compitition to feel us fresh and confident. The students who intracted in game and spoke up they received chocolates. In the End, i wanna say that i missed up that chocolates but gained the countless lesson and i was neede it alot. I resolves that never miss an oportunity again.

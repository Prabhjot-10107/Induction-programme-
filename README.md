# Day 1 
## 30th of July 2025 
My first day at GNDEC started with all students except the CSE and IT branch at the college Gurudwara Sahib where all the students have started their first day of their college and the atmosphere was very calm and the Gurudwara was very beautifully decorated. As after the Kirtan finished at Gurudwara sahib, we went to take the snaks and tea as per provided by the college in hostel no. 2. After that, we all go to Auditorium which was looking soo good as it was properly managed and the stage was also looking so good. After waiting for sometime, the host invited the speaker, Harpreet Mam HOD of applied science. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family and we are students.

Our Princpal Sir, motivated us to make the best use of platform. As our orientation was very good as it was the 70th anniverssary of GNDEC. Its been 70 years of shaping brillient minds. As it sounds very good that we were the part of their cellebration of 70th anniversary, which were dedicated to establishing the institute
